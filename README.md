# coupons_5.1
Based on my observations regarding the acceptance of the bar coupons:
1- Bar coupons are only the second from the bottom in terms of coupon types as a volume
2- Bar coupons accepted rates are high for the ones that attend bars between 1-time and 3-times, along with gt8 and 4 and 8. People that haven't been to a Bar. Their rejection rates are very high, followed by less 1-time bar visitors.
3- Total bar coupons accepted are 827 vs 1,190 rejected.
4- between onetime to 3-times bar visitors have a 12.88% acceptance rate vs the never-been in a bar that has a 33.77% rejection rate.
5- Bar coupon-accepted for individuals that have attended bars less than one and have accpeted 3 times or less coupons have the highest acceptance rate, 32.96%
6- Bar coupon-accepted for individuals that have attended bars more than 4~8 and have accpeted 4 times or more coupons have the highest acceptance rate, 48.14% 
7- Acceptance rate for bar coupons for drivers that go one or more times to a bar in a month that are over age 25 have higher acceptance rate vs rejection.
8- The acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that weren't a kid and had jobs other than farming, fishing, or forestry has higher acceptance vs rejection.
9- Acceptance for coupons is higher for the ones that go to bars more than once a month, and had passengers that weren't a kid, and weren't widowed. Same as for the ones that go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.
